      "story": "This platform was founded by a Natural Sciences teacher who has spent many years guiding BAC students toward success. Teaching, for him, was never just a profession—it was a mission. His greatest passion was seeing his students understand, grow, and achieve their goals in the final exam. Over time, however, he went through a period of illness and exhaustion. It was during this difficult time that a profound question came to mind:",
      "question": "What will happen to my students if I can't be there to teach them?",
      "turningPoint": {
        "title": "The turning point",
        "description": "That question marked a turning point in his journey as an educator. He realized that students needed a reliable source of knowledge that went beyond his presence in the classroom. From this came the idea of a digital space—a place where lessons live on, accessible anytime, ensuring that learning continues without interruption and giving students the freedom to study with confidence."
