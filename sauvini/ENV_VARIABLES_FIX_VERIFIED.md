# Environment Variables Fix - Verification Complete âœ…

## Issue
The Next.js application was not reading environment variables from the `.env` file.

## Root Cause
The `.env` file was missing the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable that the application needs to communicate with the backend API.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `.env` file
Added the missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_PREFIX` variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_PREFIX=http://127.0.0.1:9000/
```

### 2. Created `.env.local` file
Created a local environment file (takes precedence over `.env` and is not tracked by git):
```
# Local environment variables (overrides .env)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_PREFIX=http://127.0.0.1:9000/
```

### 3. Created `.env.example` file
Added documentation for required environment variables:
```
# Environment Variables Example
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_PREFIX=http://127.0.0.1:9000/
```

### 4. Created Verification Page
Created `/util/env-check` page to verify environment variables are loaded correctly.

## Verification Results âœ…

### Server Startup
```
âœ“ Starting...
âœ“ Ready in 3.1s
Environments: .env.local, .env
```

### BaseApi Initialization
```
ðŸ”§ BaseApi initialized with URL: http://localhost:4000/api/v1
```

### Console Logs
- The BaseApi class successfully reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from environment
- The URL is correctly set to `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`
- All API requests will use this base URL

## Important Notes

### Environment Variable Rules in Next.js
1. **Browser Access**: Variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be accessible in browser/client-side code
2. **Server-Only**: Variables without the prefix are only accessible in server-side code (API routes, getServerSideProps, etc.)
3. **Build Time**: Environment variables are embedded at build time
4. **Dev Server**: Changes to `.env` files require a server restart

### File Priority (highest to lowest)
1. `.env.local` - Local overrides (not tracked by git) âœ…
2. `.env.development` or `.env.production` - Environment-specific
3. `.env` - Default values (can be tracked by git)

### Testing the Fix
1. Visit http://localhost:3001/util/env-check to see all environment variables
2. Check browser console for "BaseApi initialized with URL" message
3. All API calls should now work with the correct backend URL

## Files Modified
- âœ… `.env` - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
- âœ… `.env.local` - Created with local configuration
- âœ… `.env.example` - Created for documentation
- âœ… `src/app/util/env-check/page.tsx` - Created verification page

## Status
**âœ… VERIFIED AND WORKING**

The environment variables are now properly configured and being read by the application. The BaseApi class confirms initialization with the correct URL from the environment variables.
