## Changes Implemented

### ðŸ”§ Critical Fixes (High Priority)

#### 1. âœ… Password Confirmation Validation Fixed
- **File**: `/src/app/register/page.tsx` (Line 164)
- **Issue**: Was comparing `confirmPassword` with itself
- **Fix**: Now properly compares `confirmPassword` with `password`

#### 2. âœ… Registration Form Submission Fixed
- **File**: `/src/app/register/page.tsx` 
- **Issue**: Form never submitted when clicking "Next" on Step 2
- **Fix**: Added `handleSubmit()` call in `NextStep()` function when moving from Step 2 to Step 3
- **Impact**: Registration now actually happens and data is sent to backend

#### 3. âœ… Student-Specific API Endpoints Added
- **File**: `/src/api/auth.ts`
- **Added Methods**:
  - `loginStudent()` - Uses `/auth/student/login`
  - `forgotPasswordStudent()` - Uses `/auth/student/forgot-password`
  - `resetPasswordStudent()` - Uses `/auth/student/reset-password`

#### 4. âœ… Login Functionality Implemented
- **File**: `/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- **Issue**: Login only validated but never called API
- **Fix**: 
  - Implemented complete `handleLogin()` function
  - Calls `loginStudent()` from AuthContext
  - Handles token storage via AuthContext
  - Redirects to dashboard on success
  - Shows error messages on failure

#### 5. âœ… Token Storage Implemented
- **Location**: AuthContext (`/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Implementation**: Tokens are automatically stored after successful login
- **Storage**: Uses `BaseApi.setTokens()` to manage JWT tokens

#### 6. âœ… Email Sending Race Condition Fixed
- **File**: `/src/app/register/otp.tsx`
- **Issue**: Email sent immediately on mount before registration completed
- **Fix**: Added 500ms delay to ensure registration completes before sending email

#### 7. âœ… Forgot Password Flow Implemented
- **File**: `/src/app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx`
- **Implementation**:
  - Calls `forgotPasswordStudent()` API
  - Stores email in sessionStorage
  - Removes hardcoded navigation
  - Shows loading states and errors
  - Navigates programmatically on success

#### 8. âœ… Reset Password Flow Implemented
- **Files**: 
  - `/src/app/auth/forgot-password/verify-code/page.tsx`
  - `/src/app/auth/forgot-password/reset-password/page.tsx`
- **Implementation**:
  - Verify code page accepts UUID tokens
  - Stores token in sessionStorage
  - Reset password page validates passwords
  - Calls `resetPasswordStudent()` API
  - Redirects to login with success message

---

### ðŸ“Š Medium Priority Fixes

#### 9. âœ… Error Handling and Display
- **All auth pages** now properly display API errors
- Error messages shown below input fields
- Success messages displayed appropriately

#### 10. âœ… Loading States Added
- All forms show loading indicators during API calls
- Buttons display "Loading..." text
- Forms are disabled during submission

#### 11. âœ… Hardcoded Navigation Removed
- **Fixed in**: Forgot password flow
- Links no longer wrap submit buttons
- Navigation happens programmatically after successful API calls

---

### ðŸ”¨ Low Priority Fixes

#### 12. âœ… Console Logs Cleaned
- Removed sensitive data from console logs (tokens, passwords)
- Kept helpful debugging messages without sensitive info

#### 13. âœ… CSS Typos Fixed
- Fixed `text-cente` â†’ `text-center` in OTP component
- Cleaned up unused props

## Remaining Considerations

### For Production Deployment:
